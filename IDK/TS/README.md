# IDK-based anomaly detection method for time series.

IDK$^2$ for anomalous subsequence detection using non-overlapping windows and a sliding-window variant
s-IDK$^2$ are implemented in Python and can be found in **IDK_T.py** and **IDK_square_sliding.py**, respectively. 

An example of applying IDK-based methods for anomalous subsequence detection on the dataset noisy_sine is given in main.py. Run **main.py** for the result.
