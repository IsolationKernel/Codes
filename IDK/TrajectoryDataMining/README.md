This project contains source codes of Algorithm1 and Algorithm2 implemented
by IDK and all datasets in our experiments.

Structure of this project:

    datasets:
        Data2: six datasets used in previous studies.
        MoveBank: six datasets collected from movebank.
    codes:
        -- Algorithm1: source code of algorithm1
        -- Algorithm2: source code of algorithm2
        -- Algorithm3: source code of algorithm3
        preprocess: read and preprocess data.
