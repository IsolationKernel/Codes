This code is a demo of method described by the following publication: Ting, K.M., Washio, T., Zhu, Y. and Xu, Y., 2021, July. Breaking the curse of dimensionality with Isolation Kernel.

The following scripts can be used to reproduce the results in the table:
- testIR.m: the retrieval precision of 5 nearestneighbour as shown in Table 2
- testIndexing.m: Brute force vs Ball tree index as shown in Table 2
- testclustering.m: Clustering evaluation results in Table 3
- testTSNE.m: t-SNE visulaisation as shown Table 5 and Table 6
- EstimateID.m: Estimated intrinsic dimensions as shown in Figure 3
